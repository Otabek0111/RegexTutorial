# Regex Tutorial 
As a web development student
I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex
So that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
## Summary

The regex to be described is a pattern for validating email addresses. The regex pattern will be explained in detail, and I will provide a code snippet for it.

Regex Pattern for Email Validation:
```
^(?=.{1,256})(?=.{1,64}@.{1,255}$)(?=.{1,256}\..{1,256}$)(?=.{1,63}\..{1,63}\..{1,63}$)(?=.{1,256}\.\w{2,}$)^[a-zA-Z0-9_](?:(?!\\.$).){0,63}[a-zA-Z0-9]\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]*(?:(?!\\.$).){0,63}[a-zA-Z0-9]$
```

This regex pattern is designed to validate email addresses. It enforces rules for email format, including overall length restrictions and valid characters. It checks for the correct structure of the local part and the domain part of the email address.

Throughout the tutorial, I will break down each element of this regex and explain how it works. Additionally, I will provide practical examples and tips for using this regex pattern in web development applications.

## Regex Components

Regular Expressions are made up to varius components that allow you to define patterns for matching strings. The following components are used in the email validation regex pattern: Anchors, Quantifiers, OR Operator, Character Classes, Flags, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket Expressions, Greedy and Lazy Match, Boundaries, Back-references, and Look-ahead and Look-behind. 

### Anchors

Anchors are used to match a position within a string. The email validation regex pattern uses the following anchors: The most common achors are ^ and $, which match the start and end of a string, respectively. The ^ anchor is used at the beginning of the regex pattern to match the start of the string. The $ anchor is used at the end of the regex pattern to match the end of the string. 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are used to specify the number of times a character or group of characters can be repeated. The email validation regex pattern uses the following quantifiers: The most common quantifiers are *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, and {n,m}. The * quantifier matches zero or more times. The + quantifier matches one or more times. The ? quantifier matches zero or one time. The {n} quantifier matches exactly n times. The {n,} quantifier matches at least n times. The {n,m} quantifier matches at least n times but no more than m times.
