# Regex Tutorial 
As a web development student
I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex
So that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
## Summary

The regex to be described is a pattern for validating email addresses. The regex pattern will be explained in detail, and I will provide a code snippet for it.

Regex Pattern for Email Validation:
```
^(?=.{1,256})(?=.{1,64}@.{1,255}$)(?=.{1,256}\..{1,256}$)(?=.{1,63}\..{1,63}\..{1,63}$)(?=.{1,256}\.\w{2,}$)^[a-zA-Z0-9_](?:(?!\\.$).){0,63}[a-zA-Z0-9]\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]*(?:(?!\\.$).){0,63}[a-zA-Z0-9]$
```

This regex pattern is designed to validate email addresses. It enforces rules for email format, including overall length restrictions and valid characters. It checks for the correct structure of the local part and the domain part of the email address.

Throughout the tutorial, I will break down each element of this regex and explain how it works. Additionally, I will provide practical examples and tips for using this regex pattern in web development applications.

## Regex Components

Regular Expressions are made up to varius components that allow you to define patterns for matching strings. The following components are used in the email validation regex pattern: Anchors, Quantifiers, OR Operator, Character Classes, Flags, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket Expressions, Greedy and Lazy Match, Boundaries, Back-references, and Look-ahead and Look-behind. 

### Anchors

Anchors are used to match a position within a string. The email validation regex pattern uses the following anchors: The most common achors are ^ and $, which match the start and end of a string, respectively. The ^ anchor is used at the beginning of the regex pattern to match the start of the string. The $ anchor is used at the end of the regex pattern to match the end of the string. 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are used to specify the number of times a character or group of characters can be repeated. The email validation regex pattern uses the following quantifiers: The most common quantifiers are *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, and {n,m}. The * quantifier matches zero or more times. The + quantifier matches one or more times. The ? quantifier matches zero or one time. The {n} quantifier matches exactly n times. The {n,} quantifier matches at least n times. The {n,m} quantifier matches at least n times but no more than m times. 

### OR Operator

The OR operator is used to match one of two or more expressions. The email validation regex pattern uses the following OR operator: The most common OR operator is |, which matches either the expression before or after the operator. For example, the regex pattern (a|b) matches either a or b. 

### Character Classes

Character classes are used to match a set of characters. The email validation regex pattern uses the following character classes: The most common character classes are \d, \w, and \s, which match a digit, word character, and whitespace character, respectively. The \d character class is used to match a digit. The \w character class is used to match a word character. The \s character class is used to match a whitespace character. 

### Flags

Flags are used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. The email validation regex pattern uses the following flags: The most common flags are i and g, which perform case-insensitive and global searches, respectively. The i flag is used to perform a case-insensitive search. The g flag is used to perform a global search. 

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping and capturing are used to group and capture subexpressions. The email validation regex pattern uses the following grouping and capturing: The most common grouping and capturing is (), which groups and captures subexpressions. For example, the pattern (cat) matches and captures cat in "The cat is black". 

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are used to match a character from a specific set of characters. The email validation regex pattern uses the following bracket expressions: The most common bracket expressions are [abc], [^abc], [a-z], [a-zA-Z], [0-9], and [a-z0-9], which match a, b, or c, not a, b, or c, a through z, a through z or A through Z, 0 through 9, and a through z or 0 through 9, respectively. The [abc] bracket expression is used to match a, b, or c. The [^abc] bracket expression is used to match any character except a, b, or c. The [a-z] bracket expression is used to match any character from a through z. The [a-zA-Z] bracket expression is used to match any character from a through z or A through Z. The [0-9] bracket expression is used to match any character from 0 through 9. The [a-z0-9] bracket expression is used to match any character from a through z or 0 through 9.


### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy and lazy match are used to match the longest and shortest possible strings, respectively. The email validation regex pattern uses the following greedy and lazy match: The most common greedy and lazy match are *, +, and ?, which match the longest possible string, one or more times, and zero or more times, respectively. The * greedy match is used to match the longest possible string, zero or more times. The + greedy match is used to match the longest possible string, one or more times. The ? greedy match is used to match the longest possible string, zero or one time. 

### Boundaries

Bounaries are used to match a position that is not preceded or followed by a specific character. The email validation regex pattern uses the following boundaries: The most common boundaries are \b and \B, which match a word boundary and a non-word boundary, respectively. The \b boundary is used to match a word boundary. The \B boundary is used to match a non-word boundary. 

### Back-references


### Look-ahead and Look-behind
